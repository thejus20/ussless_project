## Basic Details
### Team Name: KingCobra


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Nandana R - College of Engineering Trikaripur
- Member 2: Thejus K V - College of Engineering Trikaripur


### Project Description
when scan the qr code it shows the current time

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
"Millions of people around the world suffer from an inability to instantly know the exact time on a device they are already holding in their hand. Sure, they could glance at the top-right corner of their phone screen‚Ä¶ but where‚Äôs the drama in that?"

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I made a clock‚Ä¶ but you can only see it by scanning a QR code.
No reason. No purpose. Just because I could.
